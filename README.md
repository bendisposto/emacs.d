# Editing Clojure with Emacs

This gist will guide you to setting up a basic [emacs-starter-kit](https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit)-based Emacs configuration for editing Clojure.

## Getting Emacs

The first step is to get Emacs. Whatever you do, just make sure you get Emacs 24.

To paraphrase [Install the right Emacs](http://david.rothlis.net/emacs/install.html):

* On a Mac?

    $ brew install emacs --cocoa
    
* On Linux?
    
    $ your-package-manager install emacs

* On Windows?
    * Download the latest version of emacs from [http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/emacs/windows/](http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/emacs/windows/).
    * Follow the rest of the instructions on [Install the right Emacs](http://david.rothlis.net/emacs/install.html).

Once you've installed Emacs verify you have the correct version with `emacs --version`

    â–¸ emacs --version                                                                                                                                                                                  
    GNU Emacs 24.2.1

Now, for the config...

## Installing the config

To follow along with the contents of the presentation I would suggest you download and install the Emacs configuration bundled in this gist like so:

1. Clean out any existing Emacs configurations you have.
2. Clone this gist to `.emacs.d` with the command `git clone ...`
3. Launch emacs without any arguments like `$ emacs`. You'll see a number of messages fly by as Emacs installs all of the packages specified in init.el.
 
If you didn't encounter any errors you've likely arrived at a simple, stable Emacs configuration. The configuration is annotated, so feel free to read and edit as you see fit.

Enjoy

### A special note for Mac users

If you try to follow along into the Paredit sections you'll be sorely disappointed when you start trying to do things like `C-<Right>`. The problem is this: **every** Mac terminal sends the incorrect key codes to your terminal, and by-proxy, Emacs.

Fix this by following the excellent instructions of Cosmin Stejerean's [Emacs + paredit under terminal](http://offbytwo.com/2012/01/15/emacs-plus-paredit-under-terminal.html). His instructions address how to fix Terminal.app, iTerm and iTerm2 to send the proper key codes for using Paredit.
